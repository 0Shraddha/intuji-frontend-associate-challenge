# UI Design Implementation

A responsive website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I've focused on creating a clean, modular structure by separating each section into different pages and integrating them using JavaScript's fetch API. This approach improves maintainability and page loading performance.
I've integrated ApexCharts to create interactive and responsive data. The website includes smooth animations as well.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run SCSS compiler to track CSS changes
    # Make sure you have Sass installed globally
    npm install -g sass

    # Then run:
    sass --watch css/style.scss:css/style.css

    This will watch style.scss for any changes and automatically compile it to style.css every time you save the .scss file.

3. Open with Live Server
